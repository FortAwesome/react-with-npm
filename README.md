# Lets get into it!
This projet is meant to pair with the Font Awesome screencast that shows you **how to install React Font Awesome using NPM**.

## Setup
Follow these steps and you'll be up and running in no time!
1. Change directory (cd) into this project from your terminal
2. Then run `npm install` which will install any dependencies you need
3. Run `npm start` which will boot up your local server and open your default browser. You should be met with a blank white screen with the word "hello" on it.

## You're all caught up!
That's all there is to the setup. A few other things to mention are
- This is a React app created using NPX and the "npx create-react-app app-name" command
- All files not needed for this guided video have been removed
